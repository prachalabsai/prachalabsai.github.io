# The Symbiosis of Human-AI Ecosystems

In the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, we often isolate the machine from its creator. However, my research at **PrachaLabs** suggests that the most promising direction lies in the **collective ecosystem**.

## The Feedback Loop

When we observe real-world phenomena, we see that intelligence is rarely static. It is a dynamic interplay between an agent and its environment.

> "To understand the machine, we must first deeply understand the human context it inhabits."

### Core Hypothesis

1. **Iterative Alignment**: Models shouldn't just be trained; they should be raised within a feedback loop of human expert interaction.
2. **Cognitive Mirroring**: Can we design architectures that mimic human error-correction mechanisms rather than just optimization functions?

### Methodology

We propose a loss function that accounts for human alignment $\mathcal{L}_{align}$:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{align}
$$

Where $\lambda$ represents the weight of human intuition in the loop.
