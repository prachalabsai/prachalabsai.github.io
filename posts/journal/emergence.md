# Emergence

I am observing a pattern in how we approach research. We tend to wait for the "final result" before documenting the process. 

**PrachaLabs** is an attempt to invert this. 

I want to capture the *emergence* of a thought. How a vague intuition about "cognitive mirroring" in LLMs starts as a messy scribble and slowly, through experimentation, converges into a mathematical definition.

### The Equation of Thought

We often model thought $T$ as a function of input $x$ and parameters $\theta$:

$$
T(x) = f(x; \theta)
$$

But human thought includes a feedback term $\epsilon$ (intuition/noise):

$$
T_{human}(x) = f(x; \theta) + \epsilon(t)
$$

* **Hypothesis**: Documentation is not a post-mortem; it is the heartbeat of the experiment.
* **Action**: Set up the trackers.
